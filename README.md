# Momentum Clone 

## About
This productivity app is a clone of the famous Momentum Chrome Extension. It was created during a Chingu Voyage in collaboration with  [Tetsuya A](https://github.com/peppertaro) & [Sarah](https://github.com/smellaphant). Find the original repo [here](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v9-toucans-team-05).<br>
I was responsible for the weather, clock, greeting section, link section and quote section.
